              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Tetrahydrocannabinol, otherwise known as THC, is the cannabinoid in cannabis plants and cannabis infused products largely responsible for the psychoactive effect associated with using cannabis. The effects of THC range from euphoria to increased sensory awareness.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Although there is no inherent difference between the cannabis plants produced for medical patients and recreational customers, the manner in which products are manufactured does differ. This primarily includes the high amount of THC that is contained within a cannabis infused product for Medical Patients and the purchasing limits set for Medical Patients in one transaction.

              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Indica is one of the three cannabis species; Indica, sativa, Ruderalis. Indica effects have been reported to be more body-focused, physically relaxing effects.

                  Sativa cannabis strains are reported to have uplifting, cerebral highs that can be described as energizing and creativity inducing. 
                  
                  Hybrid cannabis strains are composed of a combination of two or more different strains of cannabis. Cannabis growers have been increasing potency of THC in strains by creating mixtures of sativa-dominant and indica-dominant strains.

                  <p>Topicals are infused with cannabis by using cannabis oil. Since topical application of cannabis does not breach the bloodstream or get consumers “high”, topicals are often used to treat the body’s endocannabinoid system. 

                    Topicals carried at Yuma Way dispensaries are available in THC or a variety of CBD:THC ratios.

                <div class="accordion-content">
                  <p>Everyone’s body has a different tolerance level to the compounds in cannabis, so it is important to consume a small amount of THC edibles, observe the effect, and then alter the dosage if necessary. The state of Colorado has defined a standard edible dose for recreational consumers to be 10mg of active THC. Remember you can always break up an edible into smaller pieces to find your desired dose.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                  <p>On average, a high from cannabis achieved through smoking or vaporizing lasts from one to two hours. A high stemming from the consumption of edibles tends to last four to eight hours.
                    The quality of a product, the dosage being administered or consumed, and the potency of the product are factors to consider when comparing the intensity and longevity of smoking vs consuming cannabis. A factor that may take time to pinpoint is how your body metabolizes cannabis compounds.
